    McsMCP bridge - zero-dependency Windows version.

    WHY THIS EXISTS: McsMCP listens on a TCP socket, but MCP clients launch a child process
    and talk stdio. This script is that child process: it relays stdin -> TCP and TCP -> stdout.

    WHY POWERSHELL: Windows PowerShell 5.1 is preinstalled on Windows 10/11, so this needs
    NOTHING installed - unlike the Node and Python bridges, which need a runtime the user may
    not have (and which is often installed but missing from PATH, the single most common
    MCP setup failure).

    USAGE (in claude_desktop_config.json or .mcp.json):

        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "mcsmcp": {
              "command": "powershell",
              "args": [
                "-NoProfile", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass",
                "-File", "C:/full/path/mcp-bridge.ps1",
                "-Port", "27015"
              ]
            }
          }
        }

    NOTES
    - "-NoProfile" matters: a user profile can print a banner to stdout, which would corrupt
      the JSON-RPC stream. Same reason this script never writes to stdout except protocol data.
    - "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass" avoids the "running scripts is disabled" error without
      requiring the user to change a machine-wide setting.
    - Use forward slashes or escaped backslashes in the path.

    DESIGN NOTE - why this script compiles C# instead of using PowerShell scriptblocks.
    The relay must pump two directions at once. The obvious PowerShell way is a background
    runspace or a BeginRead callback, but BOTH fail here:
      - Runspace.Open() throws "Index was out of range" on some PowerShell 7 builds.
      - A scriptblock used as an AsyncCallback throws "There is no Runspace available to run
        scripts in this thread" - callbacks fire on an I/O thread with no runspace.
    Add-Type with a small C# relay sidesteps both, uses only what .NET already provides, and
    behaves identically on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.x. Compilation takes a
    moment on first run; there is no external tooling involved.

    The relay is byte-transparent: it never parses JSON. The Node/Python bridges parse each
    line so they can return a friendly JSON-RPC error when the game is not running. That
    nicety is not required by the protocol, and dropping it removes the JSON dependency
    entirely. The tradeoff: when the game is not running, the client reports a connection
    failure instead of a custom message.
