    /// HOW IT AVOIDS THE IL2CPP PROXY COLLAPSE that killed the older inspection tools:

    /// <c>Il2CppSystem.Object</c> and yields nothing readable. This tool inverts that: the caller
    /// supplies the exact type name AND the exact field paths, so nothing is discovered by reflection.
    /// That constraint is the reason it works - do not "improve" it into an automatic field finder.

    /// INSTANCE ENUMERATION uses <c>Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll</c>, NOT GetComponents. The
